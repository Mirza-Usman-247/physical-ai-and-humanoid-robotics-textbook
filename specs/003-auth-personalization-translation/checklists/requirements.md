# Specification Quality Checklist: Auth, Personalization & Translation Integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-16
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Status**: ✅ PASSED - All checklist items complete

**Spec Quality Assessment**:
- Specification is comprehensive with 43 functional requirements
- 4 prioritized user stories with independent test criteria
- 10 measurable success criteria aligned with user outcomes
- Clear entity definitions for database schema
- Assumptions documented for implementation phase
- Out-of-scope items identified for phase planning

**Ready for**: `/sp.clarify` (if clarifications needed) or `/sp.plan` (implementation planning)

**No Blockers**: Specification is ready to proceed to planning phase without additional clarifications.
