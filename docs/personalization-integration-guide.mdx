# Personalization Integration Guide

This guide explains how to add personalization features to your chapters using the `ChapterActions` component.

## What is Personalization?

The personalization feature allows students to adapt chapter content based on their:
- **Skill Levels**: AI, ML, ROS, Python, Linux (Beginner to Expert)
- **Hardware Access**: GPU, Jetson, Robot availability
- **Focus Areas**: Specific topics they want to emphasize

## How to Add Personalization to a Chapter

### Step 1: Import ChapterActions

At the top of your MDX file, after the frontmatter, add the import:

```mdx
import { ChapterActions } from '@site/src/components/Personalization';
```

### Step 2: Add ChapterActions Component

Place the `ChapterActions` component where you want the personalization UI to appear (typically at the top or bottom of the chapter):

```mdx
<ChapterActions
  chapterId="module-0-chapter-1"
  position="top"
/>
```

#### Props

- **chapterId** (required): Unique identifier for the chapter (e.g., "module-0-chapter-1")
- **position** (optional): "top" or "bottom" - where to place the component (default: "top")

### Full Example

Here's a complete example of a chapter with personalization:

```mdx
---
sidebar_position: 2
title: "Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI"
description: "Understanding the fundamentals of Physical AI"
---

import { ChapterActions } from '@site/src/components/Personalization';

# Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI

<ChapterActions
  chapterId="module-0-chapter-1-intro"
  position="top"
/>

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Define Physical AI and explain how it differs from traditional AI
- Understand the concept of embodied intelligence
- Set up a basic simulation environment

... rest of your content ...

<ChapterActions
  chapterId="module-0-chapter-1-intro"
  position="bottom"
/>
```

## Features Included

### 1. Focus Areas Selector
Students can select specific areas to focus on:
- Practical Examples
- Theoretical Depth
- Hardware Recommendations
- Step-by-Step Guides
- Advanced Topics
- Troubleshooting Tips
- Custom focus areas

### 2. Personalization Button
Triggers AI-powered content adaptation based on the student's profile.

### 3. Content Viewer
Displays personalized content with:
- Skill level indicators
- Hardware tags
- Copy and print functionality
- Toggle between original and personalized versions

### 4. Local Storage
Personalized content is stored locally (IndexedDB) for:
- Fast retrieval on subsequent visits
- No database overhead
- Session-only persistence (cleared on logout)

## Example: Live Demo

Below is a live example of the ChapterActions component:

<ChapterActions
  chapterId="personalization-demo"
  position="top"
/>

## Content Adaptation Examples

### Beginner Level
- More explanations and definitions
- Step-by-step instructions
- Simpler code examples
- More visual aids

### Expert Level
- Concise explanations
- Advanced techniques
- Performance optimizations
- Research references

### Hardware-Specific
- GPU: CUDA examples, GPU-accelerated algorithms
- Jetson: Edge computing, power optimization
- Robot: Real hardware considerations, sensor integration
- Cloud-only: Simulation-focused, cloud deployment

## API Reference

### ChapterActions Props

```typescript
interface ChapterActionsProps {
  /** Unique identifier for the chapter */
  chapterId: string;
  /** Placement of actions (top or bottom) */
  position?: 'top' | 'bottom';
}
```

## Implementation Notes

1. **Chapter ID Convention**: Use a consistent naming convention:
   - Format: `module-{X}-chapter-{Y}` or `module-{X}-chapter-{Y}-{slug}`
   - Example: `module-0-chapter-1`, `module-1-chapter-2-publisher-subscriber`

2. **Placement Strategy**:
   - Use `position="top"` for chapters where students should personalize before reading
   - Use `position="bottom"` for summaries or reviews
   - You can include both (different chapterIds) for pre/post personalization

3. **Authentication Required**:
   - The component automatically hides for non-authenticated users
   - Students must sign in to use personalization features

4. **Performance**:
   - Content extraction happens on component mount
   - Personalization API call uses free OpenRouter model (Google Gemini 2.0 Flash)
   - IndexedDB storage is fast and doesn't block the UI

## Troubleshooting

### Component Not Showing
- Verify the user is authenticated (signed in)
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure the import path is correct

### Personalization Not Working
- Check network tab for API errors
- Verify backend is running
- Check authentication token is valid

### Content Not Persisting
- Verify browser allows IndexedDB
- Check browser storage isn't full
- Note: Content is cleared on logout (by design)

## Next Steps

To integrate personalization into your chapters:

1. Add the import statement to your MDX files
2. Choose appropriate chapter IDs
3. Place ChapterActions at desired positions
4. Test with different skill levels and hardware configurations
5. Review personalized output for quality
