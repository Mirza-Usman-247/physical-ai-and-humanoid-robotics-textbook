# Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid Project

## Overview

The capstone project integrates all concepts from the previous modules into a complete autonomous humanoid system. Students will implement a voice-to-action pipeline that processes speech commands through Whisper, generates action plans with VLA models, perceives the environment through Isaac Sim, and executes actions via ROS 2 control. This project demonstrates the complete Physical AI pipeline from perception to action.

## Weekly Breakdown

| Week | Chapter | Topics | Learning Objectives | Exercises |
|------|---------|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| Week 13 | Chapter 1: Autonomous Humanoid Integration | Voice-to-Action Pipeline, System Integration, Debugging Strategies | Integrate all textbook concepts | Project: Complete autonomous humanoid implementation |

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this capstone project, students will be able to:

1. Integrate all concepts from the textbook into a complete autonomous humanoid system
2. Implement a voice-to-action pipeline using Whisper for speech recognition and VLA models for action planning
3. Deploy a complete system with Isaac Sim for perception and ROS 2 for control
4. Apply systematic debugging strategies for complex multi-component robotic systems
5. Evaluate the integrated system's performance using quantitative metrics and safety protocols
