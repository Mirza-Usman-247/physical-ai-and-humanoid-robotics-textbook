# Services & Actions in ROS 2

## Learning Objectives

1. **Distinguish** between topics, services, and actions use cases
2. **Implement** service servers and clients for discrete operations
3. **Create** action servers with feedback for long-running tasks
4. **Handle** timeouts, failures, and cancellation in action workflows

## Prerequisites

- [Chapter 2: Publisher-Subscriber](/docs/module-1-ros2/chapter-2/publisher-subscriber)

## Weekly Mapping

**Week 4 - Tuesday**: Services for discrete operations
**Week 4 - Thursday**: Actions for long-running tasks with feedback

## Motivating Scenario

*Placeholder: Humanoid grasping task with feedback (approach, grasp, lift)*

## Core Theory

*Placeholder: Service vs Action vs Topic decision tree, async patterns*

## Worked Example

*Placeholder: Navigation goal action with obstacle avoidance feedback*

## Hands-On Code

See `examples/module-1-ros2/chapter-3/`

## Exercises

1. Create service for inverse kinematics solver
2. Implement action server for "walk to pose" with progress feedback
