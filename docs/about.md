# About This Textbook

## Overview

**Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: A Complete Guide** is an open educational resource designed to bridge the gap between theoretical robotics and practical implementation of physical AI systems. This textbook covers 21 comprehensive chapters across 6 modules, progressing from foundational concepts to advanced vision-language-action models and humanoid control.

## Project Vision

We believe that education in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics should be:

- **Accessible**: Free and open to all learners worldwide
- **Practical**: Every concept paired with working code examples
- **Modern**: Covering cutting-edge tools (ROS 2, Isaac Sim, VLA models)
- **Rigorous**: 100% citation coverage, peer-reviewed content
- **Interactive**: Search, glossary, and hands-on exercises

## Authors

### Primary Author
