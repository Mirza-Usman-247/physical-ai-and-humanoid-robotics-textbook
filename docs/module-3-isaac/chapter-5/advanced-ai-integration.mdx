# Advanced AI Integration with Isaac Sim

## Learning Objectives

1. Integrate Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models with Isaac Sim
2. Implement multimodal perception pipelines (vision + language + proprioception)
3. Design hierarchical planning systems with high-level reasoning
4. Use foundation models for zero-shot task generalization
5. Deploy embodied AI agents in simulation for evaluation

## Core Concepts

### Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models

VLA models map natural language instructions and visual observations directly to robot actions:

```
Instruction: "Pick up the red cube and place it in the box"
          ↓
[Vision Encoder] → [Language Encoder] → [Action Decoder]
          ↓
Camera RGB       Text Tokens          Joint Positions
```

**Key Models**:
- **RT-2** (Google): Robotics Transformer with vision-language co-training
- **PaLM-E** (Google): Embodied multimodal language model
- **OpenVLA** (Stanford): Open-source VLA for manipulation

### Integration with Isaac Sim

```python
from omni.isaac.core import World
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

# Load VLA model
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("openvla/openvla-7b")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("openvla/openvla-7b")

# Get observation from Isaac Sim
world = World()
camera = world.scene.get_object("camera")
rgb_image = camera.get_rgba()[:, :, :3]

# Get instruction
instruction = "Pick up the red block"
inputs = tokenizer(instruction, return_tensors="pt")

# Predict action
with torch.no_grad():
    action = model(pixel_values=rgb_image, input_ids=inputs.input_ids)

# Execute in simulation
robot.apply_action(action)
```

### Hierarchical Planning

Combine high-level reasoning (LLM) with low-level control (RL policy):

1. **Task Planner** (LLM): Break instruction into subtasks
2. **Motion Planner**: Generate collision-free trajectories
3. **Controller** (RL): Execute low-level actions

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

def plan_task(instruction):
    """Use GPT-4 to decompose task."""
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a robot task planner."},
            {"role": "user", "content": f"Plan: {instruction}"}
        ]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content

# Example
subtasks = plan_task("Clean the table")
# Output: ["Pick up each object", "Place in bin", "Wipe surface"]
```

## Application

- **Natural Language Control**: Command robots with free-form instructions
- **Zero-Shot Generalization**: Handle novel objects and tasks without retraining
- **Sim-to-Real**: Train VLA policies in Isaac Sim, deploy to physical robots
- **Embodied Reasoning**: Use world models for counterfactual planning

See `examples/module-3-isaac/chapter-5/` for VLA integration examples.
