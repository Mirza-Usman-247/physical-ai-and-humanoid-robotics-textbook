# Reinforcement Learning with Isaac Gym

## Learning Objectives

1. Configure massively parallel environments (1000+) on a single GPU
2. Implement PPO training loops with Isaac Gym
3. Design reward functions for locomotion and manipulation tasks
4. Monitor training with Tensorboard and WandB
5. Deploy learned policies to Isaac Sim for validation

## Core Concepts

### Isaac Gym Architecture

Isaac Gym enables GPU-accelerated RL by running thousands of environments in parallel:

```python
from isaacgym import gymapi

gym = gymapi.acquire_gym()

# Create 4096 parallel environments
num_envs = 4096
envs = []
for i in range(num_envs):
    env = gym.create_env(sim, lower, upper, num_per_row)
    envs.append(env)

# Step all environments simultaneously on GPU
gym.simulate(sim)
gym.fetch_results(sim, True)
```

### Vectorized Environment API

- **Observation Tensor**: (num_envs, obs_dim) on GPU
- **Action Tensor**: (num_envs, act_dim) on GPU
- **Reward Tensor**: (num_envs,) computed in parallel
- **Reset Mechanism**: Automatic environment reset on termination

### PPO Training Loop

```python
import torch

class PPOAgent:
    def __init__(self, obs_dim, act_dim, num_envs):
        self.actor = ActorNetwork(obs_dim, act_dim)
        self.critic = CriticNetwork(obs_dim)
        self.num_envs = num_envs

    def train_step(self, obs, actions, rewards, dones):
        # Compute advantages
        values = self.critic(obs)
        advantages = rewards - values

        # Update actor
        log_probs = self.actor.log_prob(obs, actions)
        actor_loss = -(log_probs * advantages.detach()).mean()

        # Update critic
        critic_loss = advantages.pow(2).mean()

        return actor_loss, critic_loss
```

## Application

- **Locomotion**: Train quadruped/humanoid gaits in 30-60 minutes
- **Manipulation**: Learn complex pick-and-place policies
- **Sim-to-Real**: Transfer policies to physical robots with domain randomization

See `examples/module-3-isaac/chapter-3/` for PPO training scripts.
